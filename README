Overview
===========================================

The FedEx modual will allow you to track a package, request a 
shipping rate, and ship a package via FedEx.  It returns info
such as a shipping label(gif), tracking number, price, etc.  It allows
you to communicate with the FedEx ShipAPI Manager (win32).  There is a
catch, however.  Somewhere along the line, You will need a 
Win32 box.  If you plan on developing on the Win32 platform,
then you are all set.  Just install and run.  YOU CAN STILL
USE THIS IF YOU ARE DEVELOPING ON ANOTHER PLATFORM BY USING A PROXY.
	



Obtaining Distribution
===========================================

Businsess::FedEx:
  CPAN - http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Business/

FedEx ShipAPI Manager (REQIRED Win32):
  https://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/register.html




Installation
===========================================

REQUIRMENTS:
  1. MUST have an available win32 box somewhere on 
     the Internet.
  2. Perl 5.x
  3. FedEx ShipAPI Manager (WIN32).
     https://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/register.html

There are two ways to do this.  If you are developing on 
a Win32 platform, follow 'INSTALL WIN32'.  Otherwise
use the 'INSTALL (USING WIN32 PROXY)'.

-INSTALL WIN32
  1. Install the FedEx Ship Manager API (WIN32).
  2. Create a directory under one of your @INC paths to 
     Business if it does not already exist.
  3. Copy the file FedEx.pm to the new Business directory.
  4. Copy the directory FedEx to the new Business directory.
  DONE 

-INSTALL (USING WIN32 PROXY)
  1. On PLATFORM (Linux, UNIX, etc)

  	perl Makefile.PL
  	make
  	make install

  2. Install distribution on Win32 Platform (must be running perl)
  3. On Win32, Copy fedex.pl to your local cgi-bin (tested ok on 
     apache web server but failed with dll errors on IIS...what a surprise :).
  DONE




Using the Module
===========================================

The best way to see how to use the FedEx modual, is to take a look at
the examples track.pl, ship.pl, rate.pl under the examples directory.
Its also documented in POD format perldoc Business::FedEx::Constants and 
Business::FedEx::ShipRequest.  Also, Please take a look at the 
FedEx ShipAPI Manager User Manual for required input:
http://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/shipAPI_userGuide.pdf

CREATE A SHIPPING OBJECT:

     #Refer to Business::FedEx::Constants or the FedEx ShipAPI documentation for the required fields.

     use Business::FedEx::ShipRequest;
     $s = Business::FedEx::ShipRequest->new(constant_name=>'value',constant_name2=>'value',etc...);

SHIP A PACKAGE:

     $s->ship('username','secret','localhost','domestic');
     $s->ship('username','secret','localhost','international');

RATE A PACKAGE:

     $s->rate('username','secret','localhost','domestic');
     $s->rate('username','secret','localhost','international');

TRACK A PACKAGE:

     $s->track('username','secret','localhost','123456789098');

USE PROXY:	
     #In order to use fedex.pl (proxy interface), you must install Business::FedEx on a Win32 web 
     #server and put the fedex.pl script in Win32's cgi-bin.  You can then make a ShipRequest from 
     #any box just by including the url in the method call (instead of 'localhost').

     $s->ship('username','secret','http://www.hostname.com/cgi-bin/fedex.pl','domestic');

GET REPLY INFO:
     #Refer to Business::FedEx::Constants for constant_name information or refer to the FedEx ShipAPI documentation.

     $data = $s->get_data('constant_name');




Contacting the Author
===========================================

Please feel free to contact me with any comments/questions/suggestions/improvements reguarding this
modual.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME REGUARDING FEDEX SHIPAPI MANAGER QUESTIONS.  FedEx makes available
the FedEx Ship API Manager to Win32 AND Solaris operating environments.  I hope, in the near future,
to make available a Solaris version of Business::FedEx::ShipAPI.  If you would like to contribute to 
this effort, please contact me.
